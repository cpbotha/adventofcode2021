# Advent of Code 2021 solutions by cpbotha

I decided to try modern, as-functional-as-possible C# this year, inspired by
[encse's great work](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode).

You might also find a few 2020 solutions in this repo. I used these to warm up
my terrible C# skills.

Last year, I had fun doing [Advent of Code in
Nim](https://github.com/cpbotha/adventofcode2020). I dropped out on day 20, but
I learned so much!
